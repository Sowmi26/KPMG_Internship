This is the Virtual Internship portfolio of my work at KPMG.  Completed a simulation focused on advising a client on customer targeting with the Data, Analytics, and modeling team.
## Introduction:
   Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes & cycling accessories organization, has approached Tony Smith in KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team.  Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMGâ€™s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 
   Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transaction data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but its team is unsure how to effectively analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy. 
   The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
   
      - Customer Demographic

      - Transactions data in the past 3 months
## Task-1: Data Quality Assessment

With the given three datasets, we have to recommend that 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization.
